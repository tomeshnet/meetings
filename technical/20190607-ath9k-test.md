# Overview

This document summarizes a series of tests on a Meraki MR16 OpenWRT access point running an ATH9k integrated 5Ghz radio.  connected to the LibreRouter's 12 dBi antenna. The Meraki devices are aquireable due to their licensing model making their resale value very low.  This test was done to mirror a similar test using the LibreRouter tests done last year to be able to compair the results.

Since the MR16 board is a low end processor, the test did not use any encryption.

Our key findings are as follows:

- The radio and antenna combo creates stable links over hundreds of metres at 100 Mbps.  This is lower then last years test.
- The radio Power TX is difficult to control.  Tests where done only at 19dBm vs  26 dBm of last years. There may be firmware patches that could correct these issues.
- The 12 dBi antenna makes an excellent 5G antenna even for other radios
- Onboard 2.4 ghz radio provides acceptable distance as an omni directional Access Point.

# Testing the LibreRouter Antennas on the MR16

After flashing OpenWRT on the MR16, we disconnected the onboard omni directional 5Ghz antennas in favour of the 12 dBi LibreRouter antenna for a long distance test. 

We mounted the device with antenna outside to test.  The devices where aproximatly 220m apart.

Using ath Ath9k radio on a Meraki MR16 flashed with OpenWrt and the LibreRouter 12dBi antenna

The OpenWRT repoted 19 dBm TX power in AdHoc (IBSS) mode
Radio settings for test where in ADHOC

```

The signal strength settled at about -65dBm.

Initial speed was about 60Mbps, after positining the antenna a little better is jumped to 80-110.  It was observed that if the antennas where tuned better for direction and polarity the signal may have improved a little.

If the TX Power can be stablized these could make very cheap radio/antennas. Openwrt can be put into bridge mode to allow transparent passing of data to a Raspberry Pir or such running the prototype stack, or internally use babeld or similar to provide a mesh network support.
